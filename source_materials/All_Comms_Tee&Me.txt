This is just a quick update on our finances:

The reserves I had tried to put away the past few months have run completely dry. I'm unfortunately going to need a few  months to save and be able to be your backup. 

I'm not sure how this is going to work out but I thought I should let you know.

9/16/24, 8:08 AM - Tee ♡: Hey Mr Forty Too Handsome 😉 

My love, I write this with a heavy heart so forgive me if some of it doesn't make sense but I know that these emotions will pass.

I want to start by telling/reminding you how much of an absolutely amazing man you are. 
You've healed me Tshezi and you continuously heal different parts of me that I didn't know were wounded. 
You're my biggest flex! When I talk and think about you, my heart, body and soul sing to the same tune and I know very well it's because of all the effort you've put into our relationship.

I know there are days that you decide ukuzidela wena ukuze konwabe mna and I am forever grateful for those days.

I also know that you're not a person that celebrates but today, I want you to know that as long as I wake up next to you, I'll always celebrate the man you are in the best way I know how! 

May light, peace and prosperity find a home in you and flourish so that your dreams may become a reality. 

I love you sir, way more than I could ever be able to articulate.

9/18/24, 8:06 AM - Tee ♡: It's not even about uTshezi baby but sometimes it's the cuddles and kisses that make me aware that you are in bed but recently I wake up in the morning and I don't even know if you ever came to bed or not.

Yesterday when I woke up, you were not in bed and first thing I thought was that I did something to upset you and you decided to not come to bed

9/23/24, 9:35 AM - Tee ♡: Many organizations espouse a "People First" ethos, primarily driven by Human Resources strategies aimed at enhancing employee well-being and overall satisfaction. This approach encompasses various philosophies, including Employee Engagement, Customer Experience, and Community Impact.

Despite significant efforts to prioritize these areas, the effectiveness of "People First" strategies often hinges on understanding their impact on employees. A common shortfall in many organizations is the assumption about employees' preferences without relying on concrete data from employee surveys. This lack of empirical feedback can hinder the success of people-centric strategies.

To genuinely enhance employee engagement, improve customer experiences, and enrich community impact, I believe it is crucial for organizations to actively seek and incorporate employee input. By engaging employees in the decision-making process, organizations not only address their needs more accurately but also foster a culture of psychological safety, where employees feel valued and heard.
9/23/24, 9:38 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: It's good & to the point.

Perhaps you can include real life examples of the shortcomings of this approach.

9/23/24, 10:02 AM - Tee ♡: Just my 2cents, consulting companies are not the greatest places to work at. Yes, they're good on your CV but as employers, they're failing. Surprisingly enough, they are the ones that spit out Employee Wellness articles all the time.
9/23/24, 11:13 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Agreed,

Which is why I think they make the best example of companies that claim to be people first with top down approaches,

And the failures like these suicides show the disconnect
9/23/24, 1:38 PM - Tee ♡: I'll add that piece

9/26/24, 8:51 AM - Tee ♡: Thank you lover 😁

You always do though ❤️
9/26/24, 8:53 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I've updated the expenditure spreadsheet.

Please verify & update;
- Baseline expenditure is what you spent on rental, utilities & food,
- I've averaged utilities since they were variable,
- You can average your food spend & use the same figure
9/26/24, 8:55 AM - Tee ♡: I'll check it out when I come home
9/26/24, 9:17 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: No problem, but I need to document how it works before I forget it nam.

Using your previous expenditure to date (1 years) your utilities & rent would have been 90 grand cumulatively.

Your expenditure to date on us, travelling & emergency is 155 grand.

Please verify the 35k you spent on emergency in January & 30 k  for March.

I thought you gave me 35k between January & March and I returned 30k

The spreadsheet reflects you gave me 35k & 30k
9/26/24, 9:22 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ndicela siyenze siyigqibe later or tomorrow because I keep postponing this.

But if I'm wrong about the 30 k then it would explain why your emergency funds are depleted & I owe you 63 k.

In my head I tried to keep your cumulative expenditure not more than it would have been when you were in Kibler Park.

But clearly you've now spent significantly more, which means I need to fix that
9/26/24, 9:22 AM - Tee ♡: I was putting numbers as per my bank statements but I'll verify everything when I get home
9/26/24, 9:25 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: No problem,

I'm now even more worried because I caused this & I know how much it works your up.

Ngxesi Zizikazi
9/26/24, 9:27 AM - Tee ♡: It's okay baby, we're on it now so we'll keep a closer eye on it going forward.
9/26/24, 9:35 AM - Tee ♡: Baby isn't the other 30k for May
9/26/24, 9:36 AM - Tee ♡: <Media omitted>
9/26/24, 9:39 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I will verify on my statements nam,

I remember that in between Jan & March you gave me 35k in total. I think first you gave me 20, then 15. In my head I remember returning 30 grand 

This one I'll verify using those dates mtuwam in May
9/26/24, 9:43 AM - Tee ♡: Okay baby

9/27/24, 10:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
9/27/24, 10:46 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I've combined the 10 grand and 7400 grand to one month
9/27/24, 10:46 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Hence the 17400 instead of individual figures
9/28/24, 11:23 AM - Tee ♡: Baby, I'm going to check if any nearby optometrist have the frames I want for my old glasses.

You can do the final updates & we need to track it monthly.

I don't want you panicking again
10/3/24, 1:37 PM - Tee ♡: Okay baby, I'll do it when I come back namhlanje.
10/3/24, 6:30 PM - Tee ♡: Baby, I'm checking this against my Bank Statements and there's nothing to change unless I'm missing something?

10/5/24, 4:05 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: They finalised the return & gave me results in July,

Now they've decided to audit it
10/5/24, 4:06 PM - Tee ♡: So they've been auditing since July?
10/5/24, 4:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: They took more than 2 months with my 2023 return audit, which should have been 21 days!

They only finalised it last week when I filed a complaint in preparation for the ombudsman complaint.

After they finalised the 2024, they decided to go back to 2024, which they finalised on 17 July!

Irony is, after all the audit the return was finalised with NO changes!
10/5/24, 4:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Finalised with 2024, they went to 2023...

Which was already finalized in July
10/5/24, 4:12 PM - Tee ♡: Doesn't make sense but eventually they'll do what's right
10/5/24, 4:22 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Oh well,

I'm going to go get Chamomile tea at PnP apparently it helps
10/13/24, 10:23 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I support that, try it and see if buyabuya ubuthongo

Any idea what could be the cause ?
10/13/24, 10:35 AM - Tee ♡: I know what the cuase is baby but I don't necessarily have control over it.

There's a buyer who showed interest on one of the Cape Town properties but we've been down this road 2 times before and the process just fell off. Now my anxiety is peaking with each day of waiting for an update.
10/13/24, 11:30 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: Kodwa ke mtu wam there's nothing you can do,

Try not to think about it and just let it be.

These are beyond your control

11/6/24, 3:46 PM - Tee ♡: So baby, the Dr said that there's acid in my tummy that is actively trying to flush itself out. He said that the reason I'm coughing is not flu, it's the acid trying to come out from my throat  but the body is fighting that and so I choke when that happens which leads to coughing. 

He also said, that is why it happens a lot at night when I'm lying down and he drew the process on the whiteboard which made sense.
11/6/24, 3:48 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: That's scary
11/6/24, 3:49 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: What if uyagabha?

Getting up wasn't a problem but everything else after that was such a mission. I even felt like my vision wasn't as clear normal on the road.

11/20/24, 6:02 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: He mtuwam,

I notice that spreadsheet is incomplete.

How much did you spend on your food budget on average?

I'll update it myself
11/20/24, 6:08 AM - Tee ♡: It varied between 1500 - 2000
11/20/24, 6:08 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe baby

11/19/24, 5:38 PM - Tee ♡: null
11/20/24, 12:05 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: I've averaged it and updated the table.

I also discovered an error on the table which was causing a miscalculation.

Before today the table was only calculating rent as you baseline expense instead of everything.

As a result at the end of September it reflected I owed you about 32 grand which is what frustrated me because I thought I kept track on my head.
11/20/24, 12:08 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: This  though was because the table was not adding up everything.

It was fine on the current expenses & loans but this was being subtracted from a baseline which only considered rent.
11/20/24, 12:14 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Simplest way to show this is by using a 12 month period, September 23 to end October 24.

Adding the rent, food & utilities per month equals 10843.78

Multiply this by 12 it equals R130 125.36, this is the baseline.

Your net expenditure as at end of October was R124473.74

11/20/24, 6:30 PM - Tee ♡: Andfuni ibengathi andihoyanga your previous texts. 

I think I've told you before, money conversations make me very very anxious.

Ndivile baby but mhlambi I just don't understand. Bendingathanda ukwazi uba intsusela yalemiyalezo isuka phi? Kukho izinto mhlambi ofuna sizitshintshe? Do you perhaps want me to take any action after those texts?

Ndicela xa unexesha elaneleyo, uhlale phantsi and talk to me about them rather than texting.  I've been on edge the whole day today because of anxiety after receiving the texts ngoba I don't know if they're an FYI or FYA.

Above all, thank you for the information sthandwa sam.
11/20/24, 7:09 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: We'll talk about it.

Since I noticed you didn't sleep well on Sunday I thought it's money.

My default when you're not ok is to go to what I know always makes you anxious.

Since I thought it was me the last time I went back to the spreadsheet to update it,

I haven't checked it since the last time we discussed it.
11/20/24, 7:11 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: If I have expectations that you will have my back it is my responsibility to ensure I don't compromise that,

Let alone your financial well being.

I've been wrecking my head since Monday trying to find out what could be the issue because I thought we had the financial issue under control.

I cannot have you unwell especially if it's because of me,

So when you're unwell I go to the default thing that I know always gets you that way.
11/20/24, 7:17 PM - Tee ♡: I understand you fully well baby but this time around it's not money at all. 

I am sorry that I didn't clarify early enough for you to not worry. 

What has been on my mind is something that I doubt we can change and it also doesn't always distract me but this week it has been weighing heavily on me and I've been thinking about it a lot. Today, I can finally say I know exactly why I have been uneasy but the feeling will go away soon enough. 

Thank you for being considerate mntuwam and I really do apologize that you had to wreck your mind because I failed to articulate myself.
11/20/24, 8:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Got it.

Always know, I need you to be strong.

When you are weak I'm exposed because I depend on you to back me up.

I will always do whatever I can to get you to that position of strength,

Because it strengthens me.

We'll chat ke some other time.
11/20/24, 8:38 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: 😘

11/21/24, 9:42 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: An ID card.

I don't have an ID card and I don't want it.

I will only get it when my passport gets lost

11/22/24, 8:35 AM - Tee ♡: Yho baby, uxolo. I got here at around 08h10. 

My head is throbbing, I'm so much in my thoughts this morning.
11/22/24, 8:38 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: No problem mtuwam,

Nam I woke up annoyed today.

I cannot have a situation where anyone thinks they can just come into your space without your permission.

In future u Kwakho will call you & ask for your permission to come here.

You can discuss the request with me but no one has any right bigger than you apha.

Ku kwakho apha, this is your home & I will not tolerate anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable.
11/22/24, 8:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I assumed she understood this the last time,

Clearly she didn't.

I have no qualms if she never comes again if she doesn't respect your authority.

That goes for everyone.
11/22/24, 8:40 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: I apologize for this,

It won't happen again.
11/22/24, 9:06 AM - Tee ♡: This is what I wanted to talk to you about baby since Sunday but we haven't had time to sit and talk. When you have time, I'd like to share my sentiments.

I know you're very busy, but when I come home if you have atleast 20minutes, I'd appreciate it.
11/22/24, 9:29 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: No problem.

But this is even worse,

So you've been anxious because of this.

I'm even more annoyed
11/22/24, 9:36 AM - Tee ♡: Eish baby
11/22/24, 11:51 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: So here's a fun fact,

I am extremely uncomfortable having a pregnant person or baby in my home, let alone that heavily pregnant.

Too much emotional nonsense & quite frankly I have zero appetite for nursing a pregnant woman's emotion that I didn't impregnate.

In my life I was only willing to deal with that once, out of a sense of duty to my lineage more than anything.

At this point I don't even want a baby in this home, next baby I'll have the patience for is my grandchild.
11/22/24, 11:54 AM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
11/22/24, 12:06 PM - Tee ♡: What puzzles me quite a bit baby is the clear messages that were sent months ago but there is somehow people that are working together to make those message null and void. 

This is not just on Kwakho. She didn't just wake up and think she'll visit and she didn't get there on her own. 

I feel like the wrath only locates her and not anyone else. 

Even with the screenshot you just sent, she has already confirmed with who?

I doubt this will solve what you're trying to do because it's not all on her. And how everyone involved *told* you to stop, what I'm trying to understand is...

1. Stop where? 
2. Stop with whose boundaries?
3. Whose resources are used to do the same thing you're trying to not entertain?
4.
11/22/24, 12:10 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: <Media omitted>
11/22/24, 12:15 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: This is the text she sent to Mavi,

U mama didn't know but wanted to see u Kwakho.

Kwakho says she wanted to surprise her mother, which I have no issue with.

The issue is that, as you confirmed I told her this a couple of months ago.

All she had to do was to do it the right way.

She failed, I have have no tolerance for such.

Mna ndihleli apha assuming that she asked you.

For some reason last night ndiyambuza, uthi hayi.

Told her to leave this morning.

I'm annoyed that u mama no Visa keep on defending this behaviour,

I've dealt with that this morning.
11/22/24, 12:39 PM - Tee ♡: To a certain extent, I feel like it comes down to what everyone else but you wants because sometimes uyathula wena seeing very well that things are not done how you want them to. 

Secondly, I feel like whenever this happens it leaves quite a lot of questions unanswered.

1. Tina came back, was never questioned, never told to do what she was also told to do (I'm fine with that) but with Kwakho being heavily pregnant (apparently it's a sensitive period of her life, andyazi  because well 🤷🏾‍♀️) yet she is at the firing end much harsher than what Tina went through. 

2. This gives the impression that Tina is sort of the favorite between the 2 which I know isn't the case because you adore your sisters equally.

3. I'm not saying Tina should be feeling any wrath but if there's leniency on her, then that should be practiced on Kwakho as well. Maybe not on what needs to be done but more on how it is done.

4. In all honesty, I know that Tina is going to act out all her reactions to what is happening, njeba ezobe eshiyekile but with that said you possibly will not reprimand her as you did Kwakho.
11/22/24, 1:12 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: Ndihlala nabantu abadala mtuwam,

I have little interest of treating them like babies and micromanaging.

Most things I expect that once the principle have been laid, people will adults.

Kwakho is actually not on the firing end, 
- I'm actually proud that she grew up and is building a home with her boyfriend, I have told her as such.
- Me approaching her as bluntly as I do is actually in her interests. 
- When one party in a relationship thinks they have a choice they never fully invest, through thick & thin because they know I have a plan B. 
- I'm deliberately forcing her out so that she can invest in her home.

As for Tina, as is the case with everyone I deal with people my own way. 
- Most of the time you don't even know what goes on behind the scenes, but I deal with things.
- Right now you have the messages because I shared them, the group is only for messages when all of them try to defend a wrong act, otherwise I deal with the individual.
- Ultimately though, every family has a Tina, that's what family is for. 
- I have thresholds & the reality is within certain limits I am not justified tossing her out.
- When she went beyond those boundaries she was out, at that point I couldn't have been bothered even if she came back in a coffin.

Unfortunately whether I like it or not I have a duty & within certain thresholds I am not justified being excessive.

Kwakho has something good, dare I say great so I need her to make it work.

Tina on the other hand has, well, nothing! As long as she stays within certain thresholds I'll grit my teeth & tolerate, outside of those though I'm justified taking the most extreme stance as done before.
11/22/24, 1:16 PM - Salatiso Mdeni: It is not a mistake that I only have one child, 

I've been burdened by duty all my life, if I deemed that ideal I would have repeated it for u Sazi.

There's things I was born into I just have to tolerate, but those I can change have been, especially for the future.

Most importantly though, people mature differently, sometimes not. If Tina chooses to mature slowly she needs to understand she will be treated as such with Zero say & authority, in fact as things stand her opinion counts for less than half of even that of Solo, I have told her as such.
11/22/24, 1:20 PM - Tee ♡: Ndiyakuva sthandwa sam and I definitely understand where you're coming from and the way you deal with people and situations regarding them.

9/13/24, 12:52 PM - Salatiso: Cool
9/13/24, 2:54 PM - Salatiso: null
9/16/24, 8:08 AM - Tee ♡: Hey Mr Forty Too Handsome 😉 

My love, I write this with a heavy heart so forgive me if some of it doesn't make sense but I know that these emotions will pass.

I want to start by telling/reminding you how much of an absolutely amazing man you are. 
You've healed me Tshezi and you continuously heal different parts of me that I didn't know were wounded. 
You're my biggest flex! When I talk and think about you, my heart, body and soul sing to the same tune and I know very well it's because of all the effort you've put into our relationship.

I know there are days that you decide ukuzidela wena ukuze konwabe mna and I am forever grateful for those days.

I also know that you're not a person that celebrates but today, I want you to know that as long as I wake up next to you, I'll always celebrate the man you are in the best way I know how! 

May light, peace and prosperity find a home in you and flourish so that your dreams may become a reality. 

I love you sir, way more than I could ever be able to articulate.
9/16/24, 8:46 AM - Salatiso: I could never have wished for a better partner mtuwam as I navigate ubomi.

Ndiyabulela Zizikazi, uyandigcwalisa, 

With you I'm content.

9/17/24, 8:45 AM - Salatiso: Are you ok this morning?

You didn't go to the gym
9/17/24, 8:49 AM - Tee ♡: No baby but I'll be good 🤞🏽
9/17/24, 8:49 AM - Salatiso: What's wrong?
9/17/24, 9:01 AM - Tee ♡: <Media omitted>
9/17/24, 9:35 AM - Salatiso: Ndiyakuva mtuwam,

Kodwa if it's about finances I'll sort it out and we will go.

I understand your heavy heart. 

Uthi umgcwabo unini?
9/17/24, 9:41 AM - Salatiso: Don't carry these burdens alone, we're in this together.

Ndicela uthethe when you've got such issues.

Even if you're worried about finances, bring them up & allow me to work with you.

Iingxaki zemali zohlala zikhona, but don't be scared to raise them.

Even if I can't come with you I will make a plan
9/17/24, 9:51 AM - Salatiso: The reason I go to Eastern Cape is not because I love to, but I love you.

That's why I said these trips are our thing, not your thing alone.
9/17/24, 10:23 AM - Tee ♡: Ndiyakuva sthandwa and thank you for the reassurance and also hearing me out. 

Let's talk about it when I come home later
9/17/24, 3:36 PM - Tee ♡: <Media omitted>
9/17/24, 6:06 PM - Salatiso: Hayibo?
9/17/24, 6:06 PM - Salatiso: ?
9/17/24, 6:08 PM - Tee ♡: I wanted to respond to this baby but I got destructed by work 😩
9/18/24, 6:20 AM - Tee ♡: Hi baby, I'm safe
9/18/24, 6:23 AM - Tee ♡: Did I do or say anything wrong mntuwam? The past 2 nights I feel like you've barely touched me when you get to bed. Even the soothing cuddles I feel mid sleep, I haven't felt.
9/18/24, 6:58 AM - Salatiso: Tu ke ngoku sthandwa sam.

I'm just restless, I'm not sleeping.
9/18/24, 6:58 AM - Salatiso: Sometimes when I'm tossing and turning I try ukuba ndibe secaleni so that I don't wake you.
9/18/24, 7:00 AM - Salatiso: Monday u Tshezi ebethe cwaka,

Same thing izolo.

Strange considering he was fine nge weekend.
9/18/24, 8:06 AM - Tee ♡: It's not even about uTshezi baby but sometimes it's the cuddles and kisses that make me aware that you are in bed but recently I wake up in the morning and I don't even know if you ever came to bed or not.

Yesterday when I woke up, you were not in bed and first thing I thought was that I did something to upset you and you decided to not come to bed
9/18/24, 9:02 AM - Tee ♡: I have nausea 😵
9/18/24, 9:08 AM - Salatiso: Ndiyakuva mtuwam

9/19/24, 11:34 AM - Tee ♡: I am baby and thank you for yesterday. Coming back early, making sure you're physically present and overall hearing me out. I really appreciate you.
9/19/24, 12:48 PM - Tee ♡: <Media omitted>
9/19/24, 12:49 PM - Salatiso: Awesome,

I need to document these dates kuba ndiyalibala shem
9/19/24, 1:18 PM - Tee ♡: 7 September 😭🙈

9/19/24, 1:20 PM - Tee ♡: I want to start another 1 in January. I just need to speak to my boss about it

9/20/24, 8:35 AM - Salatiso: Ok mtuwam,

9/23/24, 9:35 AM - Tee ♡: Many organizations espouse a "People First" ethos, primarily driven by Human Resources strategies aimed at enhancing employee well-being and overall satisfaction. This approach encompasses various philosophies, including Employee Engagement, Customer Experience, and Community Impact.

Despite significant efforts to prioritize these areas, the effectiveness of "People First" strategies often hinges on understanding their impact on employees. A common shortfall in many organizations is the assumption about employees' preferences without relying on concrete data from employee surveys. This lack of empirical feedback can hinder the success of people-centric strategies.

To genuinely enhance employee engagement, improve customer experiences, and enrich community impact, I believe it is crucial for organizations to actively seek and incorporate employee input. By engaging employees in the decision-making process, organizations not only address their needs more accurately but also foster a culture of psychological safety, where employees feel valued and heard.
9/23/24, 9:38 AM - Salatiso: It's good & to the point.

Perhaps you can include real life examples of the shortcomings of this approach.

9/23/24, 10:02 AM - Tee ♡: Just my 2cents, consulting companies are not the greatest places to work at. Yes, they're good on your CV but as employers, they're failing. Surprisingly enough, they are the ones that spit out Employee Wellness articles all the time.
9/23/24, 11:13 AM - Salatiso: Agreed,

Which is why I think they make the best example of companies that claim to be people first with top down approaches,

And the failures like these suicides show the disconnect
9/23/24, 1:38 PM - Tee ♡: I'll add that piece
9/23/24, 4:27 PM - Tee ♡: The level of cravings I have 😫, ingathi these upcoming periods will have me bedridden
9/25/24, 6:40 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe baby
9/25/24, 2:00 PM - Salatiso: He mtuwam

9/25/24, 2:00 PM - Tee ♡: Sthandwa
9/25/24, 2:05 PM - Salatiso: Oops,

Nevermind.

Bread is baking
9/25/24, 2:06 PM - Tee ♡: Just as I was responding to ask how many
9/25/24, 2:16 PM - Salatiso: Yho,

As if bendizozazi🤪
9/26/24, 6:11 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe baby
9/26/24, 7:47 AM - Tee ♡: Baby, I think undosulele 🙄
9/26/24, 8:50 AM - Salatiso: Hayibo
9/26/24, 8:51 AM - Salatiso: Don't worry I'll be here to take care of you.
9/26/24, 8:51 AM - Tee ♡: Thank you lover 😁

You always do though ❤️
9/26/24, 8:53 AM - Salatiso: I've updated the expenditure spreadsheet.

Please verify & update;
- Baseline expenditure is what you spent on rental, utilities & food,
- I've averaged utilities since they were variable,
- You can average your food spend & use the same figure
9/26/24, 8:55 AM - Tee ♡: I'll check it out when I come home
9/26/24, 9:17 AM - Salatiso: No problem, but I need to document how it works before I forget it nam.

Using your previous expenditure to date (1 years) your utilities & rent would have been 90 grand cumulatively.

Your expenditure to date on us, travelling & emergency is 155 grand.

Please verify the 35k you spent on emergency in January & 30 k  for March.

I thought you gave me 35k between January & March and I returned 30k

The spreadsheet reflects you gave me 35k & 30k
9/26/24, 9:22 AM - Salatiso: Ndicela siyenze siyigqibe later or tomorrow because I keep postponing this.

But if I'm wrong about the 30 k then it would explain why your emergency funds are depleted & I owe you 63 k.

In my head I tried to keep your cumulative expenditure not more than it would have been when you were in Kibler Park.

But clearly you've now spent significantly more, which means I need to fix that
9/26/24, 9:22 AM - Tee ♡: I was putting numbers as per my bank statements but I'll verify everything when I get home
9/26/24, 9:25 AM - Salatiso: No problem,

I'm now even more worried because I caused this & I know how much it works your up.

Ngxesi Zizikazi
9/26/24, 9:27 AM - Tee ♡: It's okay baby, we're on it now so we'll keep a closer eye on it going forward.
9/26/24, 9:35 AM - Tee ♡: Baby isn't the other 30k for May
9/26/24, 9:36 AM - Tee ♡: <Media omitted>
9/26/24, 9:39 AM - Salatiso: I will verify on my statements nam,

I remember that in between Jan & March you gave me 35k in total. I think first you gave me 20, then 15. In my head I remember returning 30 grand 

This one I'll verify using those dates mtuwam in May
9/26/24, 9:43 AM - Tee ♡: Okay baby
9/27/24, 10:40 AM - Salatiso: I found them 😁
9/27/24, 10:40 AM - Salatiso: <Media omitted>
9/27/24, 10:46 AM - Salatiso: I've combined the 10 grand and 7400 grand to one month
9/27/24, 10:46 AM - Salatiso: Hence the 17400 instead of individual figures
9/28/24, 11:12 AM - Salatiso: null
9/28/24, 11:23 AM - Tee ♡: Baby, I'm going to check if any nearby optometrist have the frames I want for my old glasses.

10/3/24, 8:48 AM - Tee ♡: I'm okay sthandwa sam, I'm just light headed and I think it's the periods but either than that I'm good.

Unjani wena baby?
10/3/24, 8:57 AM - Salatiso: At least,

I guess now that you know it's the periods then kungcono.

Ndiyavuya uphilile, 

Nam ndiphilile enkosi.
10/3/24, 8:58 AM - Tee ♡: Enkosi sthandwa sam for checking up on me ❤️
10/3/24, 1:34 PM - Salatiso: He mtuwam,

Ungalibali ngesa spreadsheet.

You can do the final updates & we need to track it monthly.

I don't want you panicking again
10/3/24, 1:37 PM - Tee ♡: Okay baby, I'll do it when I come back namhlanje.
10/3/24, 6:30 PM - Tee ♡: Baby, I'm checking this against my Bank Statements and there's nothing to change unless I'm missing something?
10/3/24, 7:10 PM - Salatiso: Cool,

As long as everything matches.

That's now the master tracker

10/5/24, 4:05 PM - Salatiso: They finalised the return & gave me results in July,

Now they've decided to audit it
10/5/24, 4:06 PM - Tee ♡: So they've been auditing since July?
10/5/24, 4:09 PM - Salatiso: They took more than 2 months with my 2023 return audit, which should have been 21 days!

They only finalised it last week when I filed a complaint in preparation for the ombudsman complaint.

After they finalised the 2024, they decided to go back to 2024, which they finalised on 17 July!

Irony is, after all the audit the return was finalised with NO changes!
10/5/24, 4:10 PM - Salatiso: Finalised with 2024, they went to 2023...

Which was already finalized in July
10/5/24, 4:12 PM - Tee ♡: Doesn't make sense but eventually they'll do what's right
10/5/24, 4:22 PM - Salatiso: Oh well,

Life goes on

I'm going to go get Chamomile tea at PnP apparently it helps
10/13/24, 10:23 AM - Salatiso: I support that, try it and see if buyabuya ubuthongo
10/13/24, 10:23 AM - Salatiso: U Xolo mtu wam,

Any idea what could be the cause ?
10/13/24, 10:35 AM - Tee ♡: I know what the cuase is baby but I don't necessarily have control over it.

There's a buyer who showed interest on one of the Cape Town properties but we've been down this road 2 times before and the process just fell off. Now my anxiety is peaking with each day of waiting for an update.
10/13/24, 11:30 AM - Salatiso: Kodwa ke mtu wam there's nothing you can do,

Try not to think about it and just let it be.

These are beyond your control
10/13/24, 12:19 PM - Tee ♡: Thank you my love, I'm really trying not to be too invested in the process

11/6/24, 3:46 PM - Tee ♡: So baby, the Dr said that there's acid in my tummy that is actively trying to flush itself out. He said that the reason I'm coughing is not flu, it's the acid trying to come out from my throat  but the body is fighting that and so I choke when that happens which leads to coughing. 

He also said, that is why it happens a lot at night when I'm lying down and he drew the process on the whiteboard which made sense.
11/6/24, 3:48 PM - Salatiso: That's scary
11/6/24, 3:49 PM - Salatiso: What if uyagabha?

11/20/24, 6:02 AM - Salatiso: He mtuwam,

I notice that spreadsheet is incomplete.

How much did you spend on your food budget on average?

I'll update it myself
11/20/24, 6:08 AM - Tee ♡: It varied between 1500 - 2000
11/20/24, 6:08 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe baby
11/20/24, 12:05 PM - Salatiso: I've averaged it and updated the table.

I also discovered an error on the table which was causing a miscalculation.

Before today the table was only calculating rent as you baseline expense instead of everything.

As a result at the end of September it reflected I owed you about 32 grand which is what frustrated me because I thought I kept track on my head.
11/20/24, 12:08 PM - Salatiso: This  though was because the table was not adding up everything.

It was fine on the current expenses & loans but this was being subtracted from a baseline which only considered rent.
11/20/24, 12:14 PM - Salatiso: Simplest way to show this is by using a 12 month period, September 23 to end October 24.

Adding the rent, food & utilities per month equals 10843.78

Multiply this by 12 it equals R130 125.36, this is the baseline.

Your net expenditure as at end of October was R124473.74

Ndicela xa unexesha elaneleyo, uhlale phantsi and talk to me about them rather than texting.  I've been on edge the whole day today because of anxiety after receiving the texts ngoba I don't know if they're an FYI or FYA.

Above all, thank you for the information sthandwa sam.
11/20/24, 7:09 PM - Salatiso: We'll talk about it.

Since I noticed you didn't sleep well on Sunday I thought it's money.

My default when you're not ok is to go to what I know always makes you anxious.

Since I thought it was me the last time I went back to the spreadsheet to update it,

I haven't checked it since the last time we discussed it.
11/20/24, 7:11 PM - Salatiso: If I have expectations that you will have my back it is my responsibility to ensure I don't compromise that,

Let alone your financial well being.

I've been wrecking my head since Monday trying to find out what could be the issue because I thought we had the financial issue under control.

I cannot have you unwell especially if it's because of me,

So when you're unwell I go to the default thing that I know always gets you that way.
11/20/24, 7:17 PM - Tee ♡: I understand you fully well baby but this time around it's not money at all. 

I am sorry that I didn't clarify early enough for you to not worry. 

What has been on my mind is something that I doubt we can change and it also doesn't always distract me but this week it has been weighing heavily on me and I've been thinking about it a lot. Today, I can finally say I know exactly why I have been uneasy but the feeling will go away soon enough. 

Thank you for being considerate mntuwam and I really do apologize that you had to wreck your mind because I failed to articulate myself.
11/20/24, 8:38 PM - Salatiso: Got it.

Always know, I need you to be strong.

When you are weak I'm exposed because I depend on you to back me up.

I will always do whatever I can to get you to that position of strength,

Because it strengthens me.

We'll chat ke some other time.
11/20/24, 8:38 PM - Salatiso: 😘

It's for Amazon,

The pricks deactivated books because I can't use my ID & licence for verification.
11/21/24, 9:27 AM - Salatiso: Nawe futhi
11/21/24, 9:29 AM - Tee ♡: 🤣 burst my bubble, won't you?

Hayi bathi sebenzisa ntoni? So they only accept passports?
11/21/24, 9:42 AM - Salatiso: An ID card.

I don't have an ID card and I don't want it.

I will only get it when my passport gets lost
11/21/24, 10:28 AM - Tee ♡: 😅 inkani yaseDrayini 🙆🏽‍♀️
11/21/24, 5:14 PM - Tee ♡: Baby, I'm about to pack up and come home

11/21/24, 5:18 PM - Tee ♡: Okay, akhongxaki
11/22/24, 8:31 AM - Salatiso: Yho,

The traffic must be bad today
11/22/24, 8:35 AM - Tee ♡: Yho baby, uxolo. I got here at around 08h10. 

My head is throbbing, I'm so much in my thoughts this morning.
11/22/24, 8:38 AM - Salatiso: No problem mtuwam,

Nam I woke up annoyed today.

I cannot have a situation where anyone thinks they can just come into your space without your permission.

In future u Kwakho will call you & ask for your permission to come here.

You can discuss the request with me but no one has any right bigger than you apha.

Ku kwakho apha, this is your home & I will not tolerate anyone who makes you feel uncomfortable.
11/22/24, 8:40 AM - Salatiso: I assumed she understood this the last time,

Clearly she didn't.

I have no qualms if she never comes again if she doesn't respect your authority.

That goes for everyone.
11/22/24, 8:40 AM - Salatiso: I apologize for this,

It won't happen again.
11/22/24, 9:06 AM - Tee ♡: This is what I wanted to talk to you about baby since Sunday but we haven't had time to sit and talk. When you have time, I'd like to share my sentiments.

I know you're very busy, but when I come home if you have atleast 20minutes, I'd appreciate it.
11/22/24, 9:29 AM - Salatiso: No problem.

But this is even worse,

So you've been anxious because of this.

I'm even more annoyed
11/22/24, 9:36 AM - Tee ♡: Eish baby
11/22/24, 11:51 AM - Salatiso: So here's a fun fact,

I am extremely uncomfortable having a pregnant person or baby in my home, let alone that heavily pregnant.

Too much emotional nonsense & quite frankly I have zero appetite for nursing a pregnant woman's emotion that I didn't impregnate.

In my life I was only willing to deal with that once, out of a sense of duty to my lineage more than anything.

At this point I don't even want a baby in this home, next baby I'll have the patience for is my grandchild.
11/22/24, 11:54 AM - Salatiso: <Media omitted>
11/22/24, 12:06 PM - Tee ♡: What puzzles me quite a bit baby is the clear messages that were sent months ago but there is somehow people that are working together to make those message null and void. 

This is not just on Kwakho. She didn't just wake up and think she'll visit and she didn't get there on her own. 

I feel like the wrath only locates her and not anyone else. 

Even with the screenshot you just sent, she has already confirmed with who?

I doubt this will solve what you're trying to do because it's not all on her. And how everyone involved *told* you to stop, what I'm trying to understand is...

1. Stop where? 
2. Stop with whose boundaries?
3. Whose resources are used to do the same thing you're trying to not entertain?
4.
11/22/24, 12:10 PM - Salatiso: <Media omitted>
11/22/24, 12:15 PM - Salatiso: This is the text she sent to Mavi,

U mama didn't know but wanted to see u Kwakho.

Kwakho says she wanted to surprise her mother, which I have no issue with.

The issue is that, as you confirmed I told her this a couple of months ago.

All she had to do was to do it the right way.

She failed, I have have no tolerance for such.

Mna ndihleli apha assuming that she asked you.

For some reason last night ndiyambuza, uthi hayi.

Told her to leave this morning.

I'm annoyed that u mama no Visa keep on defending this behaviour,

I've dealt with that this morning.
11/22/24, 12:39 PM - Tee ♡: To a certain extent, I feel like it comes down to what everyone else but you wants because sometimes uyathula wena seeing very well that things are not done how you want them to. 

Secondly, I feel like whenever this happens it leaves quite a lot of questions unanswered.

1. Tina came back, was never questioned, never told to do what she was also told to do (I'm fine with that) but with Kwakho being heavily pregnant (apparently it's a sensitive period of her life, andyazi  because well 🤷🏾‍♀️) yet she is at the firing end much harsher than what Tina went through. 

2. This gives the impression that Tina is sort of the favorite between the 2 which I know isn't the case because you adore your sisters equally.

3. I'm not saying Tina should be feeling any wrath but if there's leniency on her, then that should be practiced on Kwakho as well. Maybe not on what needs to be done but more on how it is done.

4. In all honesty, I know that Tina is going to act out all her reactions to what is happening, njeba ezobe eshiyekile but with that said you possibly will not reprimand her as you did Kwakho.
11/22/24, 1:12 PM - Salatiso: Ndihlala nabantu abadala mtuwam,

I have little interest of treating them like babies and micromanaging.

Most things I expect that once the principle have been laid, people will adults.

Kwakho is actually not on the firing end, 
- I'm actually proud that she grew up and is building a home with her boyfriend, I have told her as such.
- Me approaching her as bluntly as I do is actually in her interests. 
- When one party in a relationship thinks they have a choice they never fully invest, through thick & thin because they know I have a plan B. 
- I'm deliberately forcing her out so that she can invest in her home.

As for Tina, as is the case with everyone I deal with people my own way. 
- Most of the time you don't even know what goes on behind the scenes, but I deal with things.
- Right now you have the messages because I shared them, the group is only for messages when all of them try to defend a wrong act, otherwise I deal with the individual.
- Ultimately though, every family has a Tina, that's what family is for. 
- I have thresholds & the reality is within certain limits I am not justified tossing her out.
- When she went beyond those boundaries she was out, at that point I couldn't have been bothered even if she came back in a coffin.

Unfortunately whether I like it or not I have a duty & within certain thresholds I am not justified being excessive.

Kwakho has something good, dare I say great so I need her to make it work.

Tina on the other hand has, well, nothing! As long as she stays within certain thresholds I'll grit my teeth & tolerate, outside of those though I'm justified taking the most extreme stance as done before.
11/22/24, 1:16 PM - Salatiso: It is not a mistake that I only have one child, 

I've been burdened by duty all my life, if I deemed that ideal I would have repeated it for u Sazi.

There's things I was born into I just have to tolerate, but those I can change have been, especially for the future.

Most importantly though, people mature differently, sometimes not. If Tina chooses to mature slowly she needs to understand she will be treated as such with Zero say & authority, in fact as things stand her opinion counts for less than half of even that of Solo, I have told her as such.
11/22/24, 1:20 PM - Tee ♡: Ndiyakuva sthandwa sam and I definitely understand where you're coming from and the way you deal with people and situations regarding them.

Awuqali ukutsho baby and I definitely understand the lesson you're imparting on them.

12/19/24, 6:53 AM - Tee ♡: In and out of the different seasons of our relationship, through all the anxiety inducing circumstances whether work or personal, I am so glad and grateful that you're the one person that I find comfort in.

I treasure the moments of your full presence, providence and protection. I pray that I never lose sight of the fact that you're an answered prayer and so much more that I didn't know I needed.

At the end of every day sometimes at the beginning of the day, I'm grateful that your arms and chest calm me down and make me feel safe every single time. 

I love you so much and with every tiny being in me.
I'm a huge and crazy fan of how you love me Tenza!

4/15/25, 1:59 PM - Salatiso: But Tee you can't ask me what you should do, do what you think is best. I always say do what is best for you all the time, if you think that means looking for a place that is up to you.
4/15/25, 2:20 PM - Tee ♡: I am not making it about me and naturally I think maybe I'm the problem because awuthethisi mna kuyo yonke lento
4/15/25, 2:28 PM - Tee ♡: I'll patiently and give you space but I also want you to know how this whole thing makes me feel.

I hope everything works out, whatever that is...
4/15/25, 6:49 PM - Salatiso: Are you back?
4/15/25, 6:50 PM - Tee ♡: Yes,still in the car though
4/15/25, 6:56 PM - Salatiso: Your food is going to get soggy, according to Tina
4/16/25, 7:39 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe
4/17/25, 7:12 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe <This message was edited>
4/18/25, 9:06 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe
4/19/25, 9:18 AM - Tee ♡: I'm safe babe
4/20/25, 6:22 PM - Tee ♡: Please ask Solo to plug the pipe for me in the morning, I want to wake up and do laundry around 8/9
4/22/25, 6:43 PM - Salatiso: Usesemsebenzini?
4/22/25, 6:43 PM - Salatiso: Tina brought a package for you
4/22/25, 7:10 PM - Tee ♡: Ewe but leaving now
4/22/25, 9:27 PM - Tee ♡: Temba says he needs a microwave, bendicinga umnika the one I used in Kibler Park ngoba andinayo imali yomthengela entsha
4/23/25, 11:17 PM - Tee ♡: This message was deleted
4/24/25, 12:08 AM - Salatiso: Why am I locked out?
4/24/25, 12:09 AM - Salatiso: I have no idea where the powerbank is,

There's a white one charging in the kitchen.
4/24/25, 12:23 AM - Tee ♡: I didn't realize that I didn't unlock
4/29/25, 8:01 AM - Tee ♡: Molo Salatiso. 

I have arranged for a few things to be fetched at the house on the 6th, I will be home already but I just wanted you to know ungothuki xa befika
5/2/25, 6:03 AM - Salatiso: Morning Tee 

This is just about the most irresponsible thing you have ever done.

You've just disappeared, you don't say where you are.

There is nothing wrong with going but do it the right way.

There l longer you do this the more impossible it is to undo.

But, if you want that that's fine. But this is totally unacceptable & immatured.

When you come back you have a lot to account & answer to.
5/2/25, 6:07 AM - Salatiso: Ndizakumxelela u bhuti wakho but this is the last time.

Ubuyintanga yokuba ndikuqhwabe ukuba bendinako but you will have to find other ways to make up for this.
5/2/25, 6:18 AM - Salatiso: But first you will be here before the day is over.

You will apologize & make amends for this because it is unacceptable.

But whatever happens today is the last day I'm not sleeping in our bed,

That is the case for you too.
5/2/25, 6:41 AM - Salatiso: My mistake,

Uzakuzixela kuye no sisi wakho. In fact uzakuzixela kusisi wakho.

She will deal with you azokucelela u xolo kum.
5/2/25, 7:24 AM - Tee ♡: Molo Salatiso, ndiyathemba ukuba uyaphila.

I will not have to tell my family anything because I am with them.

I told you I'd leave on the 24th of April and even after you told me to make alternative plans just a few days before nto leyo ingaqaliyo. Since then, I have been with my family.

Mna, ndenze exactly what I said I would do and that is to go home. 

Ungababuza nabo, they will tell you where I've been since last week Thursday. They can account for each day kude kube namhlanje.

Kuyo yonke lento, it's weird that ibonakala ngongathi you're the only one what has it hard. You have no care in the world how I feel and how I've felt since you distanced yourself ndakubuza kakuhle nangentlonipho nothando ukuba kwenzekeni and I even told you how I felt and you disregarded that.
5/2/25, 7:28 AM - Tee ♡: For a person who says they care about me, bendinocinga mhlambi you would've atleast made time to spend time with me even if it was just the day or night before of my known departure date to you but because nguwe olungileyo kuyo yonke lento and ndim who is fully wrong ombona efuna nobethwa you decided not and that's okay.

I know I could've done things differently but nawe you've chosen to do things differently. Akekho umntu phakathi kwethu who is fully right nor fully wrong for this. <This message was edited>
5/2/25, 7:32 AM - Tee ♡: Uba I had control over this situation, I would rather we give each other time to sit down and talk about what has been happening rather than shifting blame. 

I fully understand you're disgruntled but I am also dealing with emotions and thoughts that I am not used to. <This message was edited>
5/2/25, 7:43 AM - Tee ♡: Ngako konke ukuzithoba ke Tshezi, andilahlekanga mna, ndikulendayo bendithe ndizakuba kuyo, ngelixesha bendithe ndizakuba kuyo ngalo, nababantu bendithe ndizakuba nabo.
5/2/25, 8:00 AM - Tee ♡: Maybe to also set the record straight, andizobuya namhlanje. As done before, even when I'm there, ungalala apho uthanda khona sthandwa sam.
5/2/25, 10:42 AM - Salatiso: Ndiyakuva Zizikazi.

Wonwabe ke.
5/2/25, 7:47 PM - Salatiso: Yhe mtuwam,

Ndicela ucele u malume wakho abuyise iintabo, he can call the landline number to arrange.

I found your charger but you can either keep the one you have or take the one you have.
5/2/25, 7:51 PM - Salatiso: From tomorrow you can arrange with the home group to take your things, I'll be here when you come but we don't have to interact.

A week after you've taken your things delete yourself from the home group and delete all my contact details.

Please make sure to remove yours from Google photos partner sharing.

It should take about 72 hours from the time you collect your things to the sharing account being completely terminated.
5/2/25, 7:56 PM - Salatiso: Make sure to update the spreadsheet,

Check if there's any documents you're sharing with me & remove the sharing.

I think that should be it, if I've missed anything you can let me know.

When tomorrow starts there should be no need for us to communicate, use the group and if I need to reply I'll do so there.

You're home, you're safe, my job is done.

Your family knows where you were now they know you are no longer here.

I do like a clean termination so after this there should be nothing that connects me & you nor our families.

Goodbye
5/3/25, 11:00 AM - Salatiso: Good morning 

Please note I have removed you from Google;
- Partner SharingFamily Group

Please remove yourself from the family group, once you've confirmed I will either create a new group to facilitate your move or assign you to Tina who will facilitate your move independent of me.
5/3/25, 11:01 AM - Salatiso: I'm currently migrating all your files from the computer and Chromebook, I'll put them in a shared Google drive folder which you can download. I will delete them from my side on the 6th
5/3/25, 11:03 AM - Salatiso: If I'm missing something please remind me. By the 6th let's make sure you get a clean break and you have no reason to contact me. You'll still have Tina assigned to you but that will also end a week or so after the 6th.
5/3/25, 7:34 PM - Salatiso: Mamela ke Tobela,
- You are still not Tobela to me, you're still my Tee. 
- I love you, but loving you is preceded by my duty to you,
- When you do dumb shit, I will tell you it's dumb shit , this is dumb shit.
- If you commit you deliberately eliminate all choices, by yourself. Not in because you don't have them but because you choose.
- Ndamgxotha nje u Kwakho was not because I didn't love my sister, but because I wanted her to invest & commit. She's always welcomed home if shit goes south. Her son calls this home and that won't change.

Whatever happens from here is your choice, 

I still expected you here izolo,

The longer your stay away the harsher what you'll have to make up for,

Because you will account.

Or let's end this. Love you but I love my family more, if you're not that then go.

You knew this from day one
5/3/25, 7:43 PM - Salatiso: But closeout or not let's take stock, 

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qQBXJ6iGOhu7R3GaP8GznwGlXb-HRyz-YK2bvTmtv9o/edit?usp=drivesdk
5/3/25, 8:03 PM - Tee ♡: So your expectation is that I drive to sleep next to you at your earliest convenience?

You do remember that you were supposed to be here with me, right? You made a decision, and I respected it. 

The plan has always been that I'll be home and come back after my birthday, I am not willing to change that because you decided to disappoint me. 

I'll be back, but clearly not yesterday, nor today/tomorrow but trust, I'll be back after my birthday. <This message was edited>
5/3/25, 8:51 PM - Salatiso: Mtuwam I have zero expectations,
5/3/25, 8:52 PM - Salatiso: Ndiyakuthemba as an adult.

Do what works for you.

Mna I otlined my conditions because what you did will  never be accepteed in my world ( Iḿ druk hence the spelling erros)
5/3/25, 8:54 PM - Salatiso: All I am doing right now is taking stock of the relationtiop at this poiit.

If this is the end thats fine, if not youŕe fucked coz you have a lot to make up for 

(At least until I make my own fuc.. up).
5/3/25, 8:56 PM - Salatiso: But from June neither of us should wonder how this happened, 

Because when you leave I will let you go no issues and youĺl be part of my history

But if you stay you have a lot to make up for 
(You have fucked up acording to me so youŕe best leaving because you have too much to make up for)
5/3/25, 8:59 PM - Salatiso: But Ndiyakuthanda shem,

But that dont mean Im subsivient.

Sadly Iḿ still the man in this relationstiop.

My way or no way.
5/3/25, 8:59 PM - Salatiso: And Mtuwam,

I love being a man
5/3/25, 8:59 PM - Salatiso: Akukho omnye endimthanda nje ngawe
5/3/25, 9:00 PM - Salatiso: Kodwa xa u phambana,
5/3/25, 9:00 PM - Salatiso: hamba
5/3/25, 9:00 PM - Tee ♡: Ulale kamnandi sthandwa sam, ngalo eli ixesha phila ngezigqibo zakho. 

Ndikuthanda mna kuqala.
5/3/25, 9:02 PM - Salatiso: Nam ndiyakuthamnda mtu wam
5/3/25, 9:02 PM - Salatiso: Tell everyone who supoorted you in this dumb decision that I am furiois because now youŕe not her and I have bet my everything on you.
5/3/25, 9:02 PM - Salatiso: I am a horrible perosn to anger. . . .
5/3/25, 9:02 PM - Salatiso: they have angered me
5/3/25, 9:02 PM - Salatiso: So if uyabuya wena uzakunya . . .
5/3/25, 9:03 PM - Salatiso: but bazakunya more
5/3/25, 9:03 PM - Salatiso: But if you dont . . . .
5/3/25, 9:04 PM - Salatiso: Ndiyakuyathanda shem Zizikazi,

So much so that Iĺl never date a Xhosa girl after you
5/3/25, 9:04 PM - Salatiso: if  I have to
5/3/25, 9:09 PM - Tee ♡: Tshezi wam, you have said so many things on your 6 page document that hit below the belt. You've intentionally insulted me with information that I shared with you in confidence. You've initiated the process of me being disintegrated from your house and family knowing very well uba andikwenzanga niks.

Hlala, uzihlalutye izigqibo zakho. Mna ndizobuya ngexesha lam lokubuya and I guess we'll sort each other out.
5/3/25, 9:23 PM - Salatiso: Sthandwa Sam,

Kum akukho omnye ngaphandle kwakho
5/3/25, 9:24 PM - Salatiso: Kodwa if the think it's ok to just leave kukunya oko Zizikazi
5/3/25, 9:25 PM - Salatiso: To build takes commitment,

Neither of us can have options.

Either we are here or not
5/3/25, 9:26 PM - Tee ♡: Mntuwam, undigxothile nje
5/3/25, 9:27 PM - Salatiso: You left Tee
5/3/25, 9:27 PM - Salatiso: By yourself
5/3/25, 9:27 PM - Salatiso: You just left
5/3/25, 9:27 PM - Tee ♡: You know that you left me alone before I packed to go home sthandwa sam
5/3/25, 9:28 PM - Salatiso: Even when you could come back you didn't
5/3/25, 9:28 PM - Salatiso: Nditya
5/3/25, 9:28 PM - Tee ♡: Izolo, on your texts you told me in not so many words uba mandiphume ndiphele kwakho ndizibonele icebo
5/3/25, 9:29 PM - Salatiso: Nditya ntoni xa ndilambile Tobela?
5/3/25, 9:29 PM - Tee ♡: You wronged me, insulted me and kicked me out of your house. 

Ubufuna ndithini?
5/3/25, 9:30 PM - Salatiso: Xa ndibatyiwe ndityana nabani xa ungekho?
5/3/25, 9:30 PM - Salatiso: Pissed at you mtuwam
5/3/25, 9:30 PM - Salatiso: I know you're coming back but know that
5/3/25, 9:30 PM - Salatiso: You've never not known where I am
5/3/25, 9:30 PM - Salatiso: Or why I am
5/3/25, 9:31 PM - Tee ♡: When you were kicking me out of your house ubufuna ndithini ke Jalamba?
5/3/25, 9:32 PM - Salatiso: I was always here Tee
5/3/25, 9:33 PM - Salatiso: Did you ever think I was so overwhelmed I didn't want to weigh you
5/3/25, 9:33 PM - Salatiso: But I was always here,

At home,

My home,

Your home
5/3/25, 9:34 PM - Salatiso: Again I need to reiterate.....

I'm pissed right now
5/3/25, 9:35 PM - Salatiso: Have you ever said I must come back to the house and I didn't
5/3/25, 9:35 PM - Tee ♡: My love, Jalamba wam omhle...

Ngoku uthi kum, xa ndibuya I should pack my shit and go, ubusithi makuthini?
5/3/25, 9:36 PM - Salatiso: Mtuwam,

Do what feels right to you.

I love you but I have no hold over you
5/3/25, 9:37 PM - Salatiso: If you're not happy go be happy
5/3/25, 9:37 PM - Tee ♡: Awuphenduli umbuzo wam
5/3/25, 9:37 PM - Salatiso: But if you stay then let's address everything
5/3/25, 9:37 PM - Salatiso: There's no one else other than you I want by my side
5/3/25, 9:38 PM - Salatiso: But I'm disappointed that you'd let something that had nothing to do with you,

Something you know about
5/3/25, 9:38 PM - Salatiso: But let it be about you
5/3/25, 9:39 PM - Salatiso: The website is only an insignificant response to the court
5/3/25, 9:39 PM - Salatiso: There's a rebuttal a closing arguments
5/3/25, 9:40 PM - Salatiso: Much more significant and much more
5/3/25, 9:41 PM - Salatiso: But because of how much all this weighed on me I had to isolate you from its  consequences...


On me ..

Which would have been on you ...
5/3/25, 9:41 PM - Salatiso: And everyone
5/3/25, 9:41 PM - Salatiso: Now I have to fucking sleep in a freeZing workshop....
5/3/25, 9:42 PM - Salatiso: Pissed
5/3/25, 9:42 PM - Salatiso: Horny
5/3/25, 9:42 PM - Salatiso: Cold
5/3/25, 9:42 PM - Salatiso: .....
5/3/25, 9:42 PM - Salatiso: Point is ..
5/3/25, 9:51 PM - Salatiso: Tee,

Yiba nenyani because honesty is one of the reasons I chose you
5/3/25, 9:51 PM - Salatiso: When did I kick you out
5/3/25, 9:52 PM - Tee ♡: Babe, did you even look at the messages you sent me yesterday?
5/3/25, 9:53 PM - Salatiso: I shut it you out...

Not kicked you out.

Just so I could deal with what I needed to deal with 

To be prepared to go with you
5/3/25, 9:54 PM - Tee ♡: Do you want to have this conversation on a call, because you're missing my points
5/3/25, 9:55 PM - Salatiso: Noba singathini...

The principle is simple....

You can't just leave home...
5/3/25, 9:55 PM - Salatiso: No matter what!
5/3/25, 9:55 PM - Salatiso: Uyaphi?
5/3/25, 9:55 PM - Salatiso: Do you have another home?
5/3/25, 9:56 PM - Salatiso: So should I have another home as well?
5/3/25, 9:56 PM - Salatiso: You never leave home mtuwam
5/3/25, 9:56 PM - Tee ♡: You told me to make alternative plans babe
5/3/25, 9:57 PM - Salatiso: Because that means you have another home
5/3/25, 9:57 PM - Tee ♡: Ontop of that, izolo you blatantly told me that *YOU want me OUT OF YOUR HOUSE*
5/3/25, 9:57 PM - Tee ♡: You threatened to beat me up
5/3/25, 9:57 PM - Salatiso: While you are my only home
5/3/25, 9:58 PM - Salatiso: Do you think I'd beat you up
5/3/25, 9:58 PM - Salatiso: Be honest now
5/3/25, 9:59 PM - Tee ♡: You insulted me about things I can never change about myself
5/3/25, 9:59 PM - Salatiso: Tee
5/3/25, 9:59 PM - Salatiso: Do you think I'd beat you up
5/3/25, 9:59 PM - Tee ♡: Do you know why I didn't respond to your texts? It's because I know words can never be taken back
5/3/25, 10:00 PM - Tee ♡: I know you wouldn't but the fact that you thought of it is not comforting either
5/3/25, 10:00 PM - Salatiso: Well...

Other than for pleasure...

Consensual
5/3/25, 10:01 PM - Salatiso: Why would you want me to take them black
5/3/25, 10:01 PM - Tee ♡: At a time you could've have drawn from our foundation of love, you pelted stones at me
5/3/25, 10:02 PM - Tee ♡: So you meant every word you've sent to me in the past couple of days?
5/3/25, 10:02 PM - Salatiso: If you think it's worth staying wouldn't it be better to address them
5/3/25, 10:02 PM - Salatiso: You asked what would happen if you left and I told you ..

Honestly
5/3/25, 10:03 PM - Tee ♡: I suggested this kodwa mntuwam but in response to that you told me to get the fuck out of your house
5/3/25, 10:03 PM - Salatiso: I respected your right to leave
5/3/25, 10:03 PM - Tee ♡: You even removed me from your tech resources, clearly initiating everything on my behalf
5/3/25, 10:04 PM - Salatiso: And told you the conditions if you stayed
5/3/25, 10:04 PM - Salatiso: But you left Tee
5/3/25, 10:04 PM - Salatiso: I don't talk
5/3/25, 10:04 PM - Salatiso: I do
5/3/25, 10:05 PM - Salatiso: You know this
5/3/25, 10:05 PM - Tee ♡: Read this, especially the last paragraph.
5/3/25, 10:05 PM - Salatiso: Mtuwam
5/3/25, 10:05 PM - Tee ♡: Undigxothile sthandwa sam
5/3/25, 10:05 PM - Salatiso: Stop
5/3/25, 10:06 PM - Salatiso: You don't want to go
5/3/25, 10:06 PM - Salatiso: More importantly
5/3/25, 10:06 PM - Tee ♡: No, babe you said I should be honest
5/3/25, 10:06 PM - Salatiso: I don't want you to go
5/3/25, 10:06 PM - Salatiso: Stop the texts
5/3/25, 10:07 PM - Salatiso: Come home and talk
5/3/25, 10:07 PM - Tee ♡: Undigxothile kwakho, knowing very well I'd have nowhere else to go especially because ndisekhaya. How would I arrange the move?
5/3/25, 10:07 PM - Salatiso: I won't stop you
5/3/25, 10:08 PM - Tee ♡: I still maintain that you wronged me, insulted me, threatened me and kicked me out of your house ndingakwenzanga nto
5/3/25, 10:08 PM - Salatiso: Instead of facing it you left
5/3/25, 10:09 PM - Salatiso: Because you have an option to leave
5/3/25, 10:09 PM - Salatiso: I don't
5/3/25, 10:09 PM - Salatiso: Currently freezing my ass in the workshop
5/3/25, 10:09 PM - Tee ♡: Unfortunately nguwe Salatiso, nguwe osiqalisa emva apho sasiqale khona. Now we have to start from scratch
5/3/25, 10:10 PM - Salatiso: (pissed)
5/3/25, 10:10 PM - Tee ♡: Pissed at your own doing? Kanjani?
5/3/25, 10:10 PM - Salatiso: Sithini ke
5/3/25, 10:11 PM - Salatiso: Do I wake up tomorrow calling you mtuwam
5/3/25, 10:11 PM - Salatiso: Or is than done
5/3/25, 10:11 PM - Salatiso: I will let you go if you want
5/3/25, 10:12 PM - Salatiso: But to fix your home you need to be here home
5/3/25, 10:12 PM - Salatiso: You are not home
5/3/25, 10:13 PM - Tee ♡: Ngomso, you wake and remember what day it is kuqala!
5/3/25, 10:13 PM - Tee ♡: Secondly, this relationship is far from being over
5/3/25, 10:14 PM - Tee ♡: Thirdly, undigxothile and I had to secure a place to stay because I can't be in your house ungandifuni apho
5/3/25, 10:15 PM - Tee ♡: You will decide how you make this work and it better work because andizokohlukana nawe
5/3/25, 10:15 PM - Tee ♡: Make it work!
5/3/25, 10:25 PM - Salatiso: Again...
5/3/25, 10:25 PM - Salatiso: You left
5/3/25, 10:26 PM - Salatiso: When you left this is what happened
5/3/25, 10:26 PM - Tee ♡: No, don't change the narrative. Yibanenyani nawe
5/3/25, 10:27 PM - Salatiso: Now instead of confronting izinto of your home face to face you reduced yourself to the same level of the slut I'm screwing when you're not home
5/3/25, 10:28 PM - Salatiso: She can't comfortably confront me face to face so we have to text to avoid umama wekhaya
5/3/25, 10:29 PM - Tee ♡: Ngubani umama wekhaya wakho?
5/3/25, 10:30 PM - Tee ♡: The last time I checked, you said it in my presence ukuba it's not me
5/3/25, 10:30 PM - Salatiso: Yabona ke mtuwam
5/3/25, 10:30 PM - Salatiso: You've asked the perfect question
5/3/25, 10:31 PM - Salatiso: Nkqo
5/3/25, 10:32 PM - Salatiso: So you are telling me I've been sneaking around with you know who
5/3/25, 10:32 PM - Salatiso: Everyday after you leave
5/3/25, 10:32 PM - Salatiso: Out of respect for you as umama wekhaya
5/3/25, 10:33 PM - Salatiso: Yet you don't know who u mama wekhaya
5/3/25, 10:33 PM - Salatiso: Is?
5/3/25, 10:33 PM - Salatiso: Then maybe I should make my sidepiece umama wekhaya
5/3/25, 10:33 PM - Salatiso: Then I'll get a proper sidepiece
5/3/25, 10:34 PM - Salatiso: Order will be maintained.....


The sidepiece will replace you as umama wekhaya,

And I'll find a sidepiece to replace the sidepiece
5/3/25, 10:34 PM - Tee ♡: Oh yhini mntuwam, would you like me to help you choose that sidepiece?
5/3/25, 10:37 PM - Tee ♡: Oooh, I think you already have criteria! 

You did say you'll get a younger, hotter woman of child bearing age right?
5/3/25, 10:38 PM - Salatiso: Remember,

Resolving/ trying to replace your issues over text is sidepiece standard.

I'm pissed right now, you're best telling me how much you'll such my dick to make up and how often you'll initiate sex (even anal)
5/3/25, 10:38 PM - Salatiso: You have home
5/3/25, 10:38 PM - Tee ♡: I'm not doing any anal
5/3/25, 10:38 PM - Salatiso: You resolve issues home
5/3/25, 10:39 PM - Tee ♡: Secondly, I won't have sex timetable
5/3/25, 10:40 PM - Salatiso: I'll pay you if you can tell me your colleagues/ friends know where their man is as much as you do ......
5/3/25, 10:40 PM - Salatiso: Yet you always do
5/3/25, 10:40 PM - Tee ♡: Sthandwa
5/3/25, 10:40 PM - Tee ♡: Our second biggest problem here is that you kicked me out
5/3/25, 10:41 PM - Salatiso: Mamela ke mtu wam
5/3/25, 10:42 PM - Salatiso: I love you because you are independent
5/3/25, 10:42 PM - Salatiso: Do what you must
5/3/25, 10:42 PM - Salatiso: I will respect it
5/3/25, 10:44 PM - Salatiso: Again Tee....

You left!

Mtuwam you left!

I never kicked you out but you left!

And after you left I told you exactly what would happen if you wanted to go,  which is true
5/3/25, 10:44 PM - Salatiso: But you left my love
5/3/25, 10:44 PM - Tee ♡: The last part is where you are wrong baby
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: Which is why I'm pissed
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Tee ♡: Izolo you explicitly told me to leave
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: Because you left because you have somewhere to go
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: I don't
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: Now I have to sleep in the workshop
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: Again
5/3/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: Pissed
5/3/25, 10:48 PM - Tee ♡: As much as I am not leaving this relationship, we'll be in a long distance relationship. 

Again, MAKE IT FUCKEN WORK!
5/3/25, 10:49 PM - Salatiso: Trust me, I know myself .

But you're welcomed to try and all the best for you.
5/3/25, 10:50 PM - Salatiso: If you do come get your stuff as you said you would on the day you said you will everything will happen as I said..

I will stay out of your way
5/3/25, 10:51 PM - Tee ♡: Kanti ubufuna kuthini when you were even removing me from home groups?
5/3/25, 10:52 PM - Tee ♡: Uyazibona uba udlala ngam?
5/3/25, 10:53 PM - Salatiso: Then I'll realize I need a shoulder to cry on a week or two from that then get myself a 23 year old or 2 or 3 to ease the pain.....

A month or two after that I'll realize I have never been with a Japanese women and I like Japan ..

Or an Italian women...and I like ..

Well, 

You see where this is going .
5/3/25, 10:54 PM - Tee ♡: Uzobane gonorrhea uthi saaa!
5/3/25, 10:59 PM - Salatiso: If that's my fate then I'm willing to live with it,

Or die for it.

Honestly I'm content with the good I've done... Some orgies would be appropriate
5/3/25, 10:59 PM - Salatiso: But Tee....
5/3/25, 10:59 PM - Salatiso: You never leave
5/3/25, 11:00 PM - Tee ♡: You're a disgusting old man mntuwam, you know that? <This message was edited>
5/3/25, 11:00 PM - Salatiso: If you can that makes me an option
5/3/25, 11:00 PM - Salatiso: If I'm an option then leave
5/3/25, 11:00 PM - Salatiso: Because I've never been an option
5/3/25, 11:00 PM - Tee ♡: Do you know how many times I've felt like an option to you?
5/3/25, 11:00 PM - Salatiso: I am the one and only
5/3/25, 11:01 PM - Salatiso: Just like you've never felt anything Iike the one and only

5/3/25, 11:03 PM - Salatiso: Most likely didn't compre end
5/3/25, 11:04 PM - Salatiso: An hour or 2 is conservative
5/3/25, 11:04 PM - Salatiso: It's probably from the Fiat test
5/3/25, 11:04 PM - Salatiso: I'm pissed
5/3/25, 11:05 PM - Salatiso: I should never have to do this over text
5/3/25, 11:06 PM - Tee ♡: I asked you nicely if you wanted to have this conversation over a phone call and as you sometimes do while I'm under your roof, you completely ignored me
5/3/25, 11:07 PM - Tee ♡: Awundiboni xa uthanda wena baby and you take that so lightly yet it's a significant part of why we are even in this position today <This message was edited>
5/3/25, 11:17 PM - Salatiso: <Media omitted>
5/3/25, 11:22 PM - Salatiso: Kukangaphi apho umama wakho just left umzi wakhe?

5/3/25, 11:27 PM - Tee ♡: Yes, you are actually being a dick!
5/3/25, 11:27 PM - Salatiso: I have always loved you as who you are,

From how your head synced with mine ...

& No Zizikazi no Tshezi
5/3/25, 11:27 PM - Salatiso: That what you choae
5/3/25, 11:28 PM - Tee ♡: I didn't choose a dick, I chose you!
5/3/25, 11:29 PM - Tee ♡: Then I want a child, that's tangible ain't it?
5/3/25, 11:30 PM - Salatiso: What you are not getting is that everytime you're not here you're making it worse.

I'm cold  I'm shivering and not tp state the obvious (PISSED) in that workshop
5/3/25, 11:31 PM - Salatiso: Now it's anal and you initiating sex until end year
5/3/25, 11:31 PM - Salatiso: Keep it up then it's a threesome
5/3/25, 11:31 PM - Tee ♡: I refuse to be punished for YOUR actions
5/3/25, 11:32 PM - Salatiso: You're gonna have to bring a friend
5/3/25, 11:32 PM - Salatiso: Keep pushing
5/3/25, 11:32 PM - Tee ♡: Uyaqeqa wena!
5/3/25, 11:33 PM - Salatiso: Then it's an orgy
5/3/25, 11:33 PM - Tee ♡: This goes to show just how little you think of me
5/3/25, 11:34 PM - Tee ♡: Unfortunately, I won't let you win on making me inferior and of no moral standards
5/3/25, 11:35 PM - Tee ♡: Clearly, if these are your conditions, it's things you've thought about and I will NOT do them
5/3/25, 11:35 PM - Salatiso: Mtuwam,

5/3/25, 11:38 PM - Salatiso: Uphi

5/3/25, 11:41 PM - Tee ♡: Babe, you've deeply hurt me
5/3/25, 11:41 PM - Tee ♡: I don't think you understand that
5/3/25, 11:41 PM - Tee ♡: Infact, if I'm being honest ndiyakoyika
5/3/25, 11:42 PM - Salatiso: What if I said exactly the same
5/3/25, 11:42 PM - Tee ♡: I really respected you but now, I'm scared of you and I don't know how I'll ever come back from that
5/3/25, 11:42 PM - Tee ♡: I'd ask you ukuba ndikwenze ntoni?
5/3/25, 11:43 PM - Salatiso: Exactly the same that now despite trusting you with my vulnerabilities I know you can just go
5/3/25, 11:43 PM - Tee ♡: You live with your entire family 24/7. Then you make it a problem when I go see my family for a week
5/3/25, 11:43 PM - Tee ♡: That's you being a bully
5/3/25, 11:44 PM - Tee ♡: Yet, you left me to wonder if you were still mine for 2 full weeks under your roof
5/3/25, 11:44 PM - Salatiso: Can't tell you what to do.

Do what you must.

No hard feelings either way you choose
5/3/25, 11:45 PM - Salatiso: But if you choose me

5/20/25, 3:26 AM - Salatiso: One of the requirements was for mutual blocking,

I Blocked you,

You deviated.
5/20/25, 3:27 AM - Salatiso: Why we could never work apart,

We'd never listen to each other.
5/20/25, 3:28 AM - Salatiso: So,

5/20/25, 4:07 AM - Tee ♡: Good morning Njilo Njilo ❤️

I don't think I'll ever be able to express how much I love you. I wish I could listen to these songs while we dance on the open space of our bedroom but I'll unfortunately listen to them on my way driving to work. <This message was edited>
5/20/25, 11:50 AM - Salatiso: Not our bedroom.
5/20/25, 11:50 AM - Salatiso: But our home
5/20/25, 1:32 PM - Salatiso: <Media omitted>
5/20/25, 2:27 PM - Tee ♡: The t-shirt, no.

I know the hoodie but not the t-shirt
5/20/25, 9:45 PM - Salatiso: You'll never need to, I know you love me enough.

Loving me means  loving you first, 

to know to be with me it's all or nothing and if that doesn't resonate with your first love put her first.

You can never express your love more than just being honest.

You are being honest and I I could never ask for more as an expression of your love.

5/21/25, 9:17 PM - Salatiso: So there's no charger for the laptop but if it think there was one just tell Tina and Solo will search for it,

I don't remember though which explains why I made my own.
5/21/25, 9:17 PM - Tee ♡: It didn't have a charger

So all your data that was in there is safely erased,

It was password protected so not even I had access to it.
5/21/25, 9:27 PM - Salatiso: Please download all you need from the Google Photos album TT2Z ( or something like that),

I will delete it on the last day of the month.
5/21/25, 9:28 PM - Salatiso: Also download all you need from the shared Google Drive folder on the last day of the month.
5/21/25, 9:29 PM - Salatiso: There will be a full relationship Close Out Report by then.

5/21/25, 10:30 PM - Salatiso: You saw not only the emotional but psychological impacts
5/21/25, 10:30 PM - Salatiso: I only ever got sick because of court!
5/21/25, 10:30 PM - Tee ♡: Stop saying that because you neglected me and sidelined me from your life for almost a month
5/21/25, 10:31 PM - Salatiso: It was always the court.
5/21/25, 10:31 PM - Salatiso: I told you this,

You saw it in action no matter how much I hid it.
5/21/25, 10:31 PM - Salatiso: So I didn't
5/21/25, 10:31 PM - Tee ♡: I don't want to have this conversation over text, it won't make any difference.
5/21/25, 10:34 PM - Salatiso: You don't have to have this conversation over text,

Nam ndiyavuma.

But a part of me enjoys having it because I get to quantify in advance the amount of your misdemeanor.
5/21/25, 10:35 PM - Salatiso: Mtuwam,

For as long as I call you that and you reciprocate there is a rule that we must understand.

5/21/25, 10:37 PM - Salatiso: Mostly I don't mind because I know in advance
5/21/25, 10:37 PM - Tee ♡: So what was the past 18 months? Wasn't that commitment?
5/21/25, 10:38 PM - Salatiso: Tobela
5/21/25, 10:38 PM - Salatiso: You said you were a minister without portfolio.
5/21/25, 10:39 PM - Tee ♡: That is how I felt
5/21/25, 10:39 PM - Salatiso: I literally gave you a portfolio as a prerequisite
5/21/25, 10:39 PM - Tee ♡: Hints?
5/21/25, 10:39 PM - Salatiso: Not only that I gave people to handover to you while you were bilding your confidence
5/21/25, 10:40 PM - Salatiso: Did I not tell you to be my backup?
5/21/25, 10:40 PM - Tee ♡: Didn't I do that?
5/21/25, 10:40 PM - Salatiso: Did I not introduce you to my family to show you what they did for me so that you could gradually takeover and do that?
5/21/25, 10:41 PM - Tee ♡: Is there a day that you asked me to back you up that I questioned nor was I unable to do so?
5/21/25, 10:41 PM - Salatiso: None

5/21/25, 10:45 PM - Salatiso: I didn't shut down.
5/21/25, 10:45 PM - Tee ♡: So I stopped sharing...
5/21/25, 10:45 PM - Tee ♡: You did

5/21/25, 11:04 PM - Salatiso: But mtuwam, 

As you dream ukhumbule.

Qho xa uhamba nokuba ndilele you kissed me goodbye,

You told me uba uyaphi, never followed up but at least knew ukuba kukho ingxaki ndizoqala phi.

Never, ever let and never came back nokuba sowuxabene kangakanani nam.

You left in the morning, 

Came back in the afternoon and we talked about it.

You saw it was nothing to do with you and we moved on.

I felt guilty that I was a dick with my emotions irrespective of the justification so I cooked,

Kinda made the bed ( One of the best things has always been you kind of telling me how crappy of a job I did but at the same time not telling me, I knew mtuwam).

I woke up when I din't want to because you are worth it,

Went to places I never cared for because you are worth it.
5/21/25, 11:05 PM - Salatiso: Massaged you, 

faught no Tshezi xa engafuni,

Licked you from you head to your toes
5/21/25, 11:06 PM - Salatiso: (Honestly I loved these so I'm not sure if they are making my case)
5/21/25, 11:07 PM - Salatiso: Point is,

Whether I liked doing something or hated it.

*Because I love you**
5/21/25, 11:07 PM - Salatiso: Nothing else mattered more than proving that.
5/21/25, 11:11 PM - Salatiso: I need to tell you this in advance mtuwam so that xa ubuya you know what you are in for.
- Our room will no longer be our home but our room,
- Our home is bigger, it has more work and at least once a month you will know what is going on in evry corner of the home,

Hi Tee

I really need you to finalize your move, please confirm the date and time you're coming to get the rest of your items.

l would like to sleep again in  a warm room, can't do that until I remake and customize our room and remove you, I can't do that with you all over the place.


Off everything I planned for this I did not expect, I planned forever with you but you left.

So leave completely ke mtuwam, let me heal kuba mna had no idea this was coming but you did since you planned it.

So yigqibe ke sithadwa sam, be as efficient and intentional as I know you to be. I have great respect for doing what is in your best interests, and I do not want to get emotional hence I've removed myself from the group and direct instant communication with you. I don't want any proximity or unnecessarily contact with you lest I do something I will regret.

If you are not here and taken everyone by Sunday it's all going to the garage. All you do is update the documents, come get your stuff & delete yourself from the group. I don't mind if some things won't be done but at least I need to know, for example did you tell your uncle to bring back my ropes okanye should I buy another set? If he's coming you can give him the landline to make arrangements I'll brief my family, but please don't give my direct number. I let them manage things to ensure there is no unnecessary emotion.


I need a clear head from next week, thought I'd have it leading to then but I'll take the little I can get.


Regards,
Salatiso

Molo Tshezi, 

I took what I could and anything left behind can be burnt or thrown away.

I'll follow up with uBhuti about the ropes.

Thank you for everything even the reasons why we're here now are appreciated because they were a learning opportunity for me.

Noted mtuwam, I will clear what is left behind.

I have an auto response to breakups which is to avoid emotional outbursts so I thought I could be out of your way but I need to sleep, thank you for understanding and ngxesi for overreacting.

All I want is a response about the response about the ropes, if they're gone I can get others kodwa ngeCawe andifuni sibenasizathu sokuthetha. Trust me if I think I am making a mistake I'll find a way to make up for it but to date I have done nothing of said nothing I feel sorry for kuwe.

We are here because you left Tobela, don't ever forget that. You never leave and as I've said before that I admire about your mother, just as much as I admired the lessons I saw in your father for leaving.

Wena, you left. I don't mind you leaving if it's the best thing for your but never put it on me.
​

Mnatuwam ndisakuthanda ngoku kodwa ke Zizikazi ukunya I will not tolerate. When you fuck up you pay the consequences, a week ago you could have come back and it was just anal, now it's anal and a threesome!
​

I don't give a shit about anal nor threesome, you've always been enough. Now though I give a shit about both because of the gravity of your fuckup.

I'm happy for this to be the last message I ever sent to you because ndilinene sisi, I respect my womans choice even when that terminates her from that role.

You sniffled as though you took offense toe saying I'm going to replace your with a younger and better you as though that would be a first. Mamela ke sisi, kum you are the best woman I've ever been with, if you think less of yourself that's on you. Since you were the best now I'll find someone better.

You may take offense to my comment about kids but it's true. I chose not to have kids, whether that is permanent I'll or suspended depends on the woman I am with. If I find a woman that convinces me they can give me a wholesome parenting experience I'm back on the hospital table to undo it all. I could take this risk because I know both my grandfather's had kids until their grandpa's age.

If you came to me and told me you wanted kids and could assure you'd never leaver ( oh well) and would not be a witch of a mother I'd explore every option you'd be willing to, had already by the way.... But you never tried and most importantly...You left.

Of the time we've been together there's nothing I treasure more, I am still 100% grateful I met you.

Currently replacing Thank you Baby with Gerald LeVert Already Missing you.

Uhambile mtu wam (now it's two words before I stop using it) and ndizakukhumbula....

But I can let you go knowing mna I did my part and if it was not enough you are not happy, I'm happy you will find someone fitting for you.

Thankfully I have my workshop so I'll erase you by the weekend, month end lastest....

Then I'll look for your replacement.

Ndiyakuthanda nam Tshezi, I've loved you since 2023 and I still wholeheartedly love you but you said such mean things to me that hurt me. I was willing to come back as planned after my birthday, actually I was going to come back but when you make a fuss about me traveling to see my family yet you're under the same roof with yours, that's a bit questionable ain't it?

You emotionally left before I even left to go to the Eastern Cape. This is a trip we both planned since last year but again you dropped me nge last minute. How do you think that makes me feel?

Mntuwam, I still feel that you let me down and you hurt me knowing it would hurt so bad.

I've always expressed how I feel about sleeping alone but you forced me to sleep alone on numerous occasions (bendingazophinda into enye ke mnake)

I've always said our room and my heart is a safe space for you but you failed to tell me exactly what was going on even when I asked but instead you distanced yourself. Ubufuna kuthini? Ubufuna ndilinde utyhileke, then plan around you bleeding on me ngenxa yento ongandixelelanga ngayo? When would I then see my family? You were so quick to brush me off and say I must make alternative plans so I did because I wanted to spend time with my family nam as you do on a daily basis, imnandi mos uyayiva nawe?

If me staying there means these are the kind of things that will happen whenever you're dealing with difficult situations, ungandixeleli and then act as though I knew then I'm fine with loving you from afar.

Umdala, you can always make the decision to date any women from the age of 18 and have kids with her. We've had these conversations and you've always known my stance on kids and that it's not even a permanent decision, but you had to add things I've never mentioned uba wena you don't even want to get married. So ndizobe ndihlelele ntoni apho mna sthandwa sam, ndihlalele ubalixhewukazi lakwa Mtshotshisa in a Mdeni household, oh darling, that can pass me Thank You!

You brought this on our relationship, we were fine, we were working on issues as they come but nooooo, you had to test me? Mna? Haike ndiyaluthanda uxolo mntuwam andizenzi futhi nawe uyayazi lonto.

You kicked me out, telling me about how you're a monster and that I should not associate myself with monsters, you said that you're advising that I leave. You literally disconnected me from your Google home group as though you were initiating my departure. I followed your advise and actions.

Our relationship is not in that house, our relationship is between you and I. If the condition of our relationship is about me staying there and act like what you did and said is fine with me then it's clear you didn't or don't love me as much as you say you do.

I've said this before and I'll say it probably for the last time depending on you... I'm yours, have been, still am.

Kind Regards 
Tobela Tabisa Mtshotshisa

That's the thing Tobela, I never minded you being with you family, I encouraged it. 

I have never questioned uba uyaphi xa kutheni, you just always had to say, kiss me before you leave and I know where you are.

I have never denied my unavailability, but I have always told you why and each time it happens I make up for it. All the times though you always know where I am.

You are feeling left out because I leave you in bed alone but have you ever thought how heavy what I'm going through is for me to leave my sexy loving girlfriend in bed alone? Have I ever made you feel I'd rather leave you alone? Heck, has my dick ever left you alone all things normal?

No Tobela, so surely when such happens it should tell you nam I'm going through something way heavy than normal. You know where I am, you take a walk, say nothing, either sit with me or lead me back to bed to show you don't need to know but you understand.

You have never told me to be there wherem you're going through stuff and I am not, noba kwenzeka ntoni ngam I always come and hold you, sit with you zonke ezo zinto.

Mna I don't talk when going through my things, I just retract to my shell, sort my shit, come out and make up for my absence.

But in all that time you know where I am.....


I never leave the home, NEVER EVER LEAVE!

Mna I had my reasons for my distance, you knew about them and you knew zizophela and you'll be back in the pedestal again . . . . . mna I have no idea what yours were.

Oh and by the way now it's anal, threesome and an orgy!

Tee, never made you an option, I made you my only choice! When the romance is not that great because you're being a woman, something I love as I often hate about you, I still remember I have no other choice. So I suck it in and remember she often...well sometimes sucks me in!

Noba sekutheni zange uhambe uye emsebenzini ubuye worried ukuba your home won't be here, my guarantee. Even when I'm being a dick I never forget my duty to you, because xa kunetha uthando luyaphela kodwa uxanduva luhlala lukhona.

Leaving is not ok mtuwam.

You felt the consequences of being left by someone you depended on, that's how I feel.

At the same time I am shocked how this could happen because this woman is bred from the best, your mother never left no matter what! Noba utata wakho tried to replace her the woman was irreplaceable emzini wakhe, so much so that even your paternal grandmother sided with her instead of your father. Have you any idea how much I year for that?

When my mother takes your side over mine, which is why I was open from day one. 

But all this is useless and pisses me off because yonke lento could have been handled face to face ngoku I have to pretend like I'm a teenager on mixit.

I'm not doing this anymore. Mna bemdifuna umfazi, umfazi oyaziyo indawo yakhe, owns it and never lets no one interfere with that no matter what. If you think whatever made you betray me like this is bad I have news for you sisi, in this age ubuzakufumana a video of me and some random woman doing what we shouldn't and I would have expected you to say it's garbage...because undithemba kangako but most importantly uzithemba kangako emzini wakho kwindoda yakho because you know....AI and such.

But as dissapoointed as I am I am glad you decided early so that I know. I want you to be happy and I am happy I can now go have my anal and orgies. I could have always had them but I chose not to because I chose you, now one way or the other I will have them because if you come back uzoqunusa shem and have 17 other women doing the same for my pleasure daily. 

If you don't come back I still do the same, just with other women.

Maybe let me remind you ke sthandwa sam, my mother was married to my dad. She had kids with him, actually both our mothers.

Mna, I actually stayed there like a Minister without portfolio kahle kahle.

I love you, yho mntuwam with all my damn heart but after you said the things you said, you can kick me out anyday because you have no vested hold over me like a commitment of marriage or a child for that matter. 

If me staying alone is a problem for our relationship because you're a man and it's your way or no way, that means you've already made your decision because I am not living with a man ever again until the day I get married. 

I will not go through such things as a girlfriend yet they still await me as a wife, I refuse.

If you can't bare that I'm no longer in your compound, it is what it is and I'm happy for you to go have your threesomes and anals but just so you know, this will forever be a reflection point for you.

Wonwabe sthandwa sam and I wish you nothing but the absolute best.

Ngxesi, and I really mean that. You suffered over the last couple of years, I'm sorry for that.

I promise it will never happen again. You will never suffer because of me again because you are now free of me.

You did a good thing, I'm proud of you for that. Stand your ground.

Doubt you'll ever see me again so this problem part of your life is solved permanently.

- Remove yourself from the WhatsApp Group 
- Delete all my details & block me, for both our good. I have.

I am going to archive this conversation now, 

I think we now have closure. I would have liked for your to finalize the spreadsheet, but I guess we'll never know if you're better or worse off, we'll never know that you broke as contract & did not pay your fair portion but that ok, because we know.

Goodbye Tobela.

Hi Tee



Ndiyathemba uyaphila.



I know you said I can dispose of your things but I'm averse to waste in general. 



There's still lot of your perfumes, lotions and bags; I know these should be expensive and I have no use for any of them. Ukuba ibiyi Vaseline that would be a different case but ndife namthanyane kuba eyona nto ndiyisebenzisayo iphelile.



You can come get them, sisekulandawo wawuzishiye kuyo. This morning would be perfect kuba andikho until midday, but any other day with prior notice until month end would suffice.



I'd rather you come get them yourself, removing them myself somehow implies ukhutshwe ndim and ndisemselwa apho and would like to keep it that way.



You can just call the landline or anyone endlini, they will all treat you cordially.

Warm regards,
